# SAFE HAVEN PHENOTYPE FILES

## ABOUT SAFE HAVEN PHENOTYPES

Phenotypes are curated collections of clinical codings and terms that are used to extract matching Electronic Health Records (EHR) from our Glasgow systems and data sources.

Most of our local code lists correspond exactly to, or align closely with, standard phenotypes available via Health Data Research UK at:

## HOW WE USE PHENOTYPES

The Safe Haven uses phenotypes in several different ways:

1. To build cohorts against matching disease criteria eg, "Find everyone in Glasgow with heart failure"
2. To filter cohorts against matching disease criteria eg, "Link a Safe Haven cohort to all records in SMR01 with clinical coding for heart failure."
3. To build local co-morbidity files eg, "Find the first matching diagnosis of heart failure for anyone in a Safe Haven cohort, and retrieve the date of this first clinical coding."
